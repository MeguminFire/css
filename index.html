            <h2>What is a Computer?</h2>
            <p>
                A computer is an electronic device that follows instructions to process data, solve problems, and perform tasks—fast and accurately. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Computers understand instructions, called programs or software, and can perform calculations, store information, and connect people all around the world.
            </p>
            <h3>Detailed Example (for everyone):</h3>
            <p>
                Imagine a computer like a super-smart, ultra-fast chef. You give it a recipe (the program), ingredients (the data), and it quickly cooks up the dish (the result)—always following your instructions, step by step.
            </p>

            <h2>Simple Troubleshooting Tips</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Computer won’t turn on:</strong><br>
                    <span class="simple-fix">
                        - Make sure it’s plugged in.<br>
                        - Press the power button firmly.<br>
                        - Check if the power strip or outlet works (try another device).
                    </span>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Frozen or slow computer:</strong><br>
                    <span class="simple-fix">
                        - Try restarting the computer.<br>
                        - Close any extra programs or browser tabs.<br>
                        - Run a virus scan if possible.
                    </span>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>No internet connection:</strong><br>
                    <span class="simple-fix">
                        - Make sure Wi-Fi is on and connected.<br>
                        - Restart the modem/router.<br>
                        - Try connecting another device, like your phone.
                    </span>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Screen is black but computer is on:</strong><br>
                    <span class="simple-fix">
                        - Wiggle the mouse or press a key (it might be asleep).<br>
                        - Check if the monitor cable is plugged in.<br>
                        - Try turning the monitor off and on.
                    </span>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Weird noises or overheating:</strong><br>
                    <span class="simple-fix">
                        - Make sure vents aren’t blocked.<br>
                        - Clean dust using a can of air (with the computer off and unplugged).<br>
                        - Ask for help if you don’t know how or it’s still noisy—could be a fan or hard drive issue.
                    </span>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="tip"><strong>Tip:</strong> If you’re not sure what to do, write down what happened and ask an adult or support person for help. Don’t worry—everyone gets stuck sometimes!</p>
